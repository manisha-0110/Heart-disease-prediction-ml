# ❤ Heart Disease Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data using machine learning models.  
It is implemented in Google Colab using Python and common ML libraries.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `notebooks/heart_disease_prediction.ipynb` → Main notebook with code
- `data/heart.csv` → Dataset used for training and testing
- `requirements.txt` → List of required Python libraries
- `README.md` → Project documentation

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Google Colab  

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, and other medical parameters to help predict the presence of heart disease.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Ensure that the dataset file (`heart.csv`) is placed in the `data/` folder.  
3. Run all the cells in the notebook.  
4. The model will train and display prediction results such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
